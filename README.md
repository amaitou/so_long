# So_long

This project is a very small 2D game. <br />
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements using the `42 built-in library` _<mlx.h>_ **(Minilibx)**

**``` Note: I haven't shared the PDF of this project, as well as, I haven't explained anything due to school privacy reasons!```**

This project consists of two parts:
- **Mandatory part**
- **Bonus Part**

> Note: The **Bonus Part** is not that necessary to validate the project, but it gives some extra XPs and days for the **` The Blackhole`**.

# Makefile

Here are the rules that I have used in this project's makefile:

- all -> to make the mandatory part
- bonus -> to make the mandatory as well as the bonus part
- clean -> to clean the project from all executable and object file
- fclean -> It does the same thing as `clean` but it removes the compiled libraries as well
- re -> it deletes and re-compiles all the things from scratch
